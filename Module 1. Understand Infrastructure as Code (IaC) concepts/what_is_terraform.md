# What is Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and provision infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, networks, and storage, in a declarative configuration language.

With Terraform, infrastructure can be defined as code, which makes it easier to manage, version, and automate. Terraform enables users to plan and preview changes before applying them, which can help prevent mistakes and ensure that infrastructure is provisioned in a consistent and repeatable way.

Terraform supports many different providers, including public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as on-premises infrastructure like VMware and OpenStack. It is a popular tool in DevOps workflows and can be integrated with other tools like Ansible, Jenkins, and Git.

Overall, Terraform is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure in a scalable, consistent, and repeatable way, which makes it an essential tool for many modern software development teams.
