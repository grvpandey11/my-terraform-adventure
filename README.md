# My Terraform Adventure

This repository documents my learning journey with Terraform, an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your cloud infrastructure in a declarative way. Through a series of hands-on exercises, examples, and explanations, I aim to develop a strong understanding of Terraform and its key concepts, such as providers, resources, modules, variables, and state management.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout this study journey, I aim to gain the following knowledge and skills:

1. Understanding the fundamental concepts of Terraform, including its architecture, configuration language, and resource model.
1. Creating and managing infrastructure resources on various cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, using Terraform.
1. Using modules to organize and reuse Terraform code and resources.
1. Managing Terraform state files and implementing state locking mechanisms to prevent conflicts.
1. Implementing best practices and strategies for testing, debugging, and scaling Terraform code.

### Folder Structure

TBD

### Exercises

This repository will also contains a set of exercises and challenges that I will complete to reinforce my knowledge and skills in Terraform. Each exercise includes a detailed description of the task, a code snippet, and a solution with an explanation.

### Useful Resources

Throughout my Terraform study journey, I will be using various resources to deepen my understanding and knowledge of Terraform. I have included links to some of these resources below:
